Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
The goal of the app was to create an inventory application that allowed users to add and delete items, update the date items were added, and adjust item quantities.
Additionally, the app was designed to send a notification to the user when inventory levels became low. It also provided the option for users to create an account or continue without logging in. 
The application was designed to be very user-friendly and easy to use.

What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
There were a total of three screens: the login screen, the main grid screen, which included options to add, delete, and change the date of items, and the SMS notification permission screen. 
My UI design kept users in mind by being very simple and easy to use, requiring no prior knowledge. My designs were successful because they accomplished the goal of being self-explanatory, easy to understand, and easy to use.

How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those techniques or strategies be applied in the future?
I approached coding my app by breaking it into small pieces and working page by page. First, I completed the login screen because it was the first screen the user would see.
Then, I developed the main grid screen and built the logic for adding, deleting, and updating items. Finally, I completed the SMS permission screen.
My main strategy was to break the project into smaller sections and keep my notes nearby for easy reference. These techniques can be applied to solving almost any problem. 
The best way to approach large problems is to break them into smaller tasks and recognize when it is necessary to use tutorials and research to fully understand a topic before moving forward.

How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important, and what did it reveal?
I tested my code to ensure it was functional by running the Android emulator frequently after making small changes. This allowed me to see if anything broke the logic or if the application continued to work as intended. 
I believe this process is important because if you make too many changes at once before testing, it becomes difficult to know exactly what caused an issue. 
Testing often helps catch problems early and makes it easier to fix them.


Consider the full app design and development process from initial planning to finalization. Where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
The biggest challenge I faced was the lack of Java coding knowledge in this particular subject. There were many methods and functions that I did not recognize from previous courses. 
I overcame this challenge by constantly reviewing my notes and using the official Android Studio tutorials and documentation as a reference.
